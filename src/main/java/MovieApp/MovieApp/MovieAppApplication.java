// Summary of the Code
// The MovieAppApplication class is the main entry point for a Spring Boot application. It enables caching through the @EnableCaching annotation, allowing the application to cache data for improved performance. The @SpringBootApplication annotation simplifies the setup by combining multiple annotations, enabling auto-configuration, and component scanning.

// When you run this application, it starts up the Spring framework and your application context, making it ready to handle requests (if it's a web application) or perform tasks as defined in other components.

// Example Use Case
// Caching: If your application frequently retrieves data from a database (e.g., movie details), enabling caching can significantly reduce the number of database queries. By caching the results of those queries, subsequent requests for the same data can be served from the cache rather than hitting the database, leading to faster response times.
